1. result_new.csv
	Both training set and test set are stored in "result_new.csv"
	We need following data to train models:
	a.Temp_avg (celsius)
		Temp_avg = (MaxTemp + MinTemp)/2 
	b.Rainfall (mm)
	c.Evaporation (mm)
	d.Sunshine (hours)
	e.WindGustSpeed (km/h)
	f.WindSpeed_avg (km/h)
		WindSpeed_avg = (WindSpeed3pm + WindSpeed3pm)/2
	g.Humidity_Avg (percent)
		Humidity_Avg = (Humidity9am + Humidity3pm)/2
	h.Pressure_avg (hpa)
		Pressure_avg = (Pressure9am + Pressure3pm)/2
	i.Cloud_avg (oktas)	
		Cloud_avg = (Cloud3pm + Cloud9am)/2
	We predict three wheather metrics:
	a.tomorrow_rain (cetagorical: Yes, No)
	b.tomorrow_wind (cetagorical: Strong, Common)
	c.tomorrow_temp_avg (numerical: celsius)

2. Weather_model.py
	We train three model by using training set and validate it by testset. Models are saved as:
3. rain.model
4. temp.model
5. wind.model
5. Predict_model.py
 	we load above 3 models and make predictions by the input from client.
